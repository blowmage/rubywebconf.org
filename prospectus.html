<h2>Ruby|Web Conference 2010 Prospectus</h2>
<p>Please download our <a href="downloads/prospectus.pdf">prospectus</a></p>
<p>Ruby|Web Conference is both a Ruby and a Web conference to be held on September 9-10, 2010 at the Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort Rails in the beautiful Wasatch mountains of Utah. Much like our sister conference, MountainWest RubyConf, Ruby|Web Conference will be a "hacker's conference", meaning it will focus on developers and speak to them at their level. Ruby|Web will be embracing web-specific topics that many regional Ruby conferences tend to downplay. We expect topics such as Rails, Sinatra, Rack, jQuery, HAML, Mustache, Prototype, Scripty, HTML5, CSS3, OAuth, and more to be featured prominently.</p>
<p>We are soliciting sponsorships to help cover the costs of A/V recording and offering honorariums to speakers. This is a great opportunity to get your name in front of many industrious, enthusiastic and involved Ruby and Web developers.</p>
